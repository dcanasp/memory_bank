Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on [[Browser javascript|Chrome's V8]] JavaScript engine. It allows developers to write server-side JavaScript code, extending the reach of JavaScript beyond the browser. This enables building a wide range of applications, including:


#### **Key Features:**

- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Developers can leverage their existing JavaScript skills to build both client- and server-side applications.
- **Non-blocking I/O:** Node.js uses an event-driven architecture with non-blocking I/O, making it highly efficient and scalable.
- **Large Package Ecosystem:** [[npm]], the Node Package Manager, provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source modules for various functionalities.
- **Single-Threaded:** Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop model, making it ideal for applications that involve a lot of I/O operations.

#### Ecosystem:
[[npm]] and [[nvm]], one for packages the other for versions are great tools that make life easer. To check packages read [[npm]] article

The best part of Node.js is not using Node.js, but using [[typescript]]

finally you have different rune times like [[bun]] and Deno

#### **Common Modules and uses:**

- **Web servers:** Express, [[Fastify]] are popular frameworks for building web applications with Node.js.
- **Real-time applications:** Socket.io enables real-time communication between clients and servers.
- **Microservices:** Node.js is lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for building microservices architectures.
- **Command-line tools:** Node.js allows developers to build powerful and flexible command-line tools.

**Benefits:**

- **Rapid Development:** JavaScript's familiarity and a vast ecosystem of modules contribute to faster development cycles.
- **Scalability:** Node.js's event-driven architecture allows it to handle high concurrency and scalability.
- **Real-time Capabilities:** Node.js's non-blocking I/O makes it ideal for building real-time applications.
- **Cost-effective:** Node.js is open-source and readily available on various platforms, making it cost-effective for development.

**Limitations:**

- **Single-threaded:** Can be a bottleneck for CPU-intensive tasks.
- **Limited Error Handling:** Requires developers to handle errors explicitly.
