Refers to the physical elements that make up a computer system. 
Main parts:

- [[CPU]]
- [[RAM]]
- [[Physical memory]]
- [[Motherboard]]
- I/o (input / output devices)
- Power supply
and extras:
- [[GPU]]
- [[Buffer]]

hardware can be broadly categorized into two types: Desktop PCs and Laptops.

## Desktop PCs
are typically larger than laptops and are intended for use at a single location. They are known for their:

- offering **Higher Performance** compared to laptops with similar specifications. This is partly because desktop components, including CPUs and GPUs, have higher power limits and better heat dissipation capabilities, allowing them to run at higher speeds for longer periods.

- Desktops have larger cases which provide more room for effective cooling systems. This helps in **Better Heat Management**, reducing thermal throttling (slowing when to much heat) and enabling components to maintain peak performance.

- The components for desktop PCs are often **less expensive** compared to their laptop counterparts. This is due to the less complex design required for parts that don't need to be miniaturized for portable use.

- Desktops offer easier **upgrade** paths, as they have more space for additional or replacement components, and often have more compatible hardware options.

## Laptops
Laptops are portable computers that integrate most of the typical desktop components into a smaller, compact form. While they offer the advantage of **mobility**, they have some limitations:

- Heat Management 
- Performance Limitations
- Cost and Upgradeability

When you don't net to move, don't buy one. Not worth
