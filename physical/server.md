A **Server** is a [[computer]] or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a [[network]]. In essence, servers are powerful [[hardware]] or [[software]] engines that deliver critical functionality to other devices or software, allowing multiple users or clients to leverage shared resources.
Some servers like [[EC2]] are in a single machine

### Key Characteristics

- **Dedicated Resources**: Designed to handle heavy workloads with robust processing power, memory, and storage capacities.
- **Always On**: Typically operates 24/7 to provide continuous service.
- **Highly Reliable**: Built with redundant components to avoid failures and ensure uptime.

### Types of Servers

1. **Web Server**: Hosts websites and delivers web pages to client [[web browser]] using [[HTTP]].
2. **[[Database]] Server**: Provides database services, storing and retrieving data for other applications.
3. **File Server**: Stores and manages files in a central location.
4. **Mail Server**: Processes and stores emails.
5. **Application Server**: Hosts and runs specific software applications.
6. **Virtual Server**: Software-defined server simulated in a virtual environment.

### Server Roles

- **Hosting Services**: Providing a platform for hosting websites, applications, and services.
- **Data Processing**: Handling large-scale data processing tasks.
- **[[Network]] Management**: Controlling network resources and traffic.
- **Storage Services**: Offering large-scale data storage and backup solutions.

### Server Architecture

- **Client-Server Model**: Servers respond to requests from client machines.
- **Server Clusters**: Groups of servers working together for redundancy and increased performance.

### Importance factors

- **Centralization**: Central point for managing network resources and services.
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled up or down based on demand.
- **Security**: Serves as a control point for implementing security measures.
