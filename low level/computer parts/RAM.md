RAM stands for **Random Access Memory**. It's essentially your computer's **working memory**, responsible for storing data currently being used by the processor. This memory is by definition **volatile**, meaning that when power goes off, the RAM forgets what it had before

The main function is to provide space for your computer to read and write data to be accessed by the [[CPU]] quickly. RAM plays a critical role in computer performance. The more RAM you have, the more data your computer can hold in its "active zone," leading to faster processing, smoother multitasking, and quicker application loading times.

RAM accesses data in a non-sequential manner, unlike traditional hard drives. This allows the processor to instantly retrieve any piece of information stored in RAM, making it incredibly **fast**. 

**Types of RAM:** There are different types of RAM, each with its own features and performance levels. Today's common types include:
- **DDR4:** Currently the mainstream standard, offering high speeds and efficiency.
- **LPDDR4:** Designed for mobile devices, with lower power consumption and smaller size.
- **DDR5:** The newest generation, boasting even faster speeds and increased bandwidth.
