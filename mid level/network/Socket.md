The union of [[ip]] and [[port]], i don't talk to an Ip, i talk to a socker, i need to specify who in the whole [[computer]] is going to answer me. The [[protocols]] have a default port, and normally you use those (but you shouldn't specially on databases or something that the user does not access directly)
