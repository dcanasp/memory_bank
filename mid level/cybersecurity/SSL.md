The name many times is used to refer to TSL, SSL is the older version and should NOT be used. 

uses the [[hash]] SHA-256

# theory
## How it works / [[ssl||TLS]] handshake
2 parts. The **server**, that has the certificate, and the private key. And a **client**([[web browser]]) that wants to talk to that server. In the following process, they create a  session key, where the can talk in a encrypted channel with this session key 

1. **The 'client hello' message:** The client initiates the handshake by sending a "hello" message to the server. The message will include which TLS version the client supports, the cipher suites supported, and a string of random bytes known as the "**client random**."
2. **The 'server hello' message:** In reply to the client hello message, the server sends a message containing the server's [[SSL]] certificate, the server's chosen cipher suite, and the "server random," another random string of bytes that's generated by the server.
3. **Authentication:** The client verifies the server's SSL certificate with the certificate authority that issued it. This confirms that the server is who it says it is, and that the client is interacting with the actual owner of the domain.
4. **The premaster secret:** The client sends one more random string of bytes, the "premaster secret." The premaster secret is encrypted with the public key and can only be decrypted with the private key by the server. (The client gets the **public key** from the server's SSL certificate.)
5. **Private key used:** The server decrypts the premaster secret.
6. **Session keys created:** Both client and server generate **session keys** from the client random, the server random, and the premaster secret. They should arrive at the same results.
7. **Client is ready:** The client sends a "finished" message that is encrypted with a session key.
8. **Server is ready:** The server sends a "finished" message encrypted with a session key.
9. **Secure symmetric encryption achieved:** The handshake is completed, and communication continues using the session keys. A symmetric encryption

# practice
## creating [[digital certificates]] with oppenssl
first of all 
`apk add openssl`

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private-key.pem

openssl req -new -key private-key.pem -out certificate.csr

cat private-key.pem signed-certificate.crt > key-pair.pem


openssl x509 -signkey key-pair.pem -in certificate.csr -req -days 365 -out certificate.crt
```


## how to deliver

this have to be in some web [[server]] software, so you can add it to your express server on typescript, or on your net/http client on Go. The other way is to do it on a reverse proxy like [[nginx]] or [[httpd]] 


you can go all out an use this to create a [[mTLS]], a fully secure comunication pathway
