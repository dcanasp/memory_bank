The Von Neumann architecture is one of the foundational architectures for electronic computers and consists of a single memory that stores both data and instructions, a CPU that performs all computations and control functions, and I/O mechanisms.

Components:

- **Memory**: Holds both data and instructions.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs calculations and logical operations.
- **Control Unit**: Manages instruction fetching and execution.
- **Input/Output**: Interfaces for communication with the external world.
