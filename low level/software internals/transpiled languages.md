Mainly used in supersets

Transpilers (source-to-source compilers) convert code from one programming language into another. For example, [[TypeScript]] is transpiled into [[JavaScript]], which can then be interpreted or further compiled. The output is usually easier to optimize or debug than directly compiled machine code but still has to be executed by an interpreter or another compiler.

##### Advantages

- Allows for cross-platform development.
- Enables the use of advanced language features that might not be natively supported by the target language.

##### Disadvantages

- Additional build step required for transpilation.
- Possible runtime errors if the transpilation is not perfect.
