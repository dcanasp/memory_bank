The motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer, serving as the **central communication** backbone to connect various components of the system.

It allocates power and allows communication between the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and other peripherals.

## Components and Features

- **[[CPU]] Socket**: A specific slot where the processor is installed.
- **[[RAM]] Slots**: Slots for Random Access Memory (RAM) modules.
- **Chipset**: Manages data flow between the processor, memory, and peripherals.
- **Expansion Slots**: PCIe slots for video cards, sound cards, and other expansion cards.
- **[[Physical memory|Storage]] Connectors**: SATA ports for HDDs, SSDs, and optical drives.
- **I/O Ports**: USB, HDMI, Audio, and Ethernet ports for external device connections.
- **[[BIOS]]/UEFI Firmware**: The one responsable to the booting process.

## Form Factors

- **ATX**: Standard size offering good expandability.
- **Micro-ATX**: Smaller than ATX with fewer expansion slots.
- **Mini-ITX**: Compact form factor suitable for small build and less expandability.

## Importance 

- Acts as the central hub for building a computer; the type and quality of the motherboard determine the system's performance, capabilities, and expansion potential.
- Motherboard determines CPU and RAM compatibility, affecting the overall system upgrade path.
