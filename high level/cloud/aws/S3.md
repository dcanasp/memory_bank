The file storage system, it's pretty simple. Have any image, file, zip, or anything, just turn it to [[binary]] and upload it, you can have different folders

You can also store code on S3, and execute it with a [[Lambda]]

>[!info]
>Buckets name MUST be unique on all regions, but the exist only in one  region, (this is because s3 gives you a public [[url]] where you can see your bucket)

To start just create the bucket, after doing it. manage who can use it. This is done with buckets policies. Bucket policy for 

example for an all entries (insert, read, delete) policy:
it's important to note that this should NOT be done on production, on production you set only an [[IP]] to create (your [[server]])
