Logic gates are the basic **building blocks** of digital circuits. They receive 1 or 2 bits, and give a result depending on the gate type. The most used are:

- And Gate
 
  | x | y | r |
  |---|---|--|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- Or Gate

  | x | y | r |
  |---|---|--|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- Xor Gate (Exclusive Or)

  | x | y | r |
  |---|---|--|
  | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0 |

- Not Gate

  | x | r |
  |---|---|
  | 0 | 1 |
  | 1 | 0 |

Logic gates are fundamental in constructing digital circuits and are used in conjunction with **flip-flops** and switches. Understanding these gates is crucial in computer science, as they form the basis of more complex operations.

In digital electronics, **half adders** and **full adders** are important the most important components. A half adder is a circuit that adds two single binary digits and outputs a sum and a carry bit. A full adder, in contrast, adds three inputs (including a carry-in from a previous addition). With these adders, you can technically perform any computation that modern computers do, as they can be combined to execute complex arithmetic and logical operations.
