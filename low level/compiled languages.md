Languages like C, C++, and Rust require a [[compiler]] to translate the high-level code into machine code or an intermediate representation. The machine code is specific to the target architecture and can be executed directly by the [[CPU]]. The process involves various phases like lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

These need for you to define the datatypes, and you **can not** alter them after compiling
##### Advantages

- Faster execution, as compilation is done beforehand.
- More control over hardware resources.

##### Disadvantages

- Less portable, as the machine code is specific to the architecture.
