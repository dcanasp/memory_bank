The CPU is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside a computer. Is a complex electronic circuit that decodes and executes instructions from software programs. It performs arithmetic and logical operations, makes decisions, and ultimately determines how fast your computer runs.

It's main function is to execute instructions from software through basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output (I/O) operations.


# basic architecture

**Core Components**:
    - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Handles arithmetic and logical operations.
    - **Control Unit**: Directs operations of the processor.
    - **Registers**: Small storage locations for quick data access.

**Cache Memory**: Temporary storage for frequently accessed data to speed up processing.

**Pipelines**: Enhances performance by processing multiple instructions simultaneously.

## Performance Factors

- **Clock Speed**: Measured in GHz, indicates the speed at which a CPU can execute instructions.
- **Core Count**: More cores can handle more tasks simultaneously.
- **Cache Size**: Larger cache improves performance.

## Manufacturing and Design

- **Semiconductor Materials**: Typically made from silicon.
- **Microarchitecture Design**: Varies among manufacturers (e.g., Intel's Core, AMD's Ryzen).
- **Lithography**: Smaller process nodes (measured in nanometers) lead to more efficient, powerful CPUs.
