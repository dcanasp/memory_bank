# Memory Bank

Welcome to my personal Memory Bank â€“ a living compilation of my accumulated knowledge in computer science, software development, and everything in between. This is not a conventional project, but rather a digital garden where I've sown seeds of information I've learned, both as a software developer and as a computer science student.


## Overview

Contained within this repository is a diverse range of topics I've explored and documented. It's a repository that grows with me, reflecting my journey through the vast landscape of computer science. From cloud computing to the inner workings of data structures, each directory is different domain of my expertise.


## Table of Contents
- **Cloud**
	  This section provides notes and resources on cloud computing with a focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It covers various AWS services, good practices, and common pitfalls. 

- **High Level**
	  This segment explores the practical application of knowledge in software development. It addresses questions like how information is transferred, what constitutes a backend, code examples, and useful tools. It's about turning theory into practice, showcasing how concepts are implemented in real-world scenarios.

- **Images**
	  The repository of images used throughout the documentation. This includes diagrams, screenshots, and other visual aids that complement the textual content.
  
- **Low Level**
	  Here, you'll find information on the inner workings of systems. This section is mostly oriented towards the computer, it's internals and operating systems. It's a deep dive into the foundational aspects of computing systems.

- **Mid Level**
	  The most extensive section, featuring key concepts every programmer and application should be familiar with. It includes comprehensive material on Networking, Databases, Cybersecurity, as well as Data Types and Structures. This part forms the core knowledge base necessary for understanding and developing software.

- **Cloud**
	  Notes and resources on cloud computing focusing on Amazon Web Services, covering various services, some good practices and common errors.
- **High Level**
	With all learned what can you do?, how do you transfer information, whatis a backed, what are some code examples, what are some good tools? these questions are tackeld here
	
- **Images**
	Where the images are stored

- **Low Level**
	How do things work under the hood. You can find mostly OS related information

- **Mid Level**
	The biggest path, it contains the stepping stones that any application and programmer should know. These are things like Networking, Databases, Cybersecurity, Data types and structures.

- **Physical**
	Things that have an actual real world implementation, parts of the computer, logical gates and the bases of all computing
