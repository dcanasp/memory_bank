why is it good ... why bad

two competitors are [[aws]] and [[gcp]]


AWS primarily categorizes its services into three main types:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Offering raw computing resources such as [[server]]s that you manage.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Providing environments where servers and infrastructure are managed for you, allowing more focus on application development.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivering fully managed applications or software that are ready to be used by businesses, like the extensive use by Netflix.
