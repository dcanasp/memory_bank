Refers to the hardware devices used to store data temporarily or permanently. It's a critical component in computers, serving as the workspace for the CPU, allowing it to read and write data.

## Types

- [[RAM]]:
    - **Volatile Memory**, Loses its content when power is lost.
    - **Used for** Storing data and instructions currently being processed by the CPU.
- **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
    - **Non-Volatile Memory**, Retains data even without power.
    - **Used for** Storing firmware or software that is rarely changed.
- **Flash Memory**:
    - **Non-Volatile Memory**, Used in USB flash drives, SSDs.
    - **Used for** Portable storage and data transfer between devices.
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**:
    - **Non-Volatile Memory**, Uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve data using rotating disks (platters).
    - Generally **slower** due to mechanical movement; offers larger storage capacity at a lower cost.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**:
    - **Non-Volatile Memory**, Uses flash memory for faster data access.
    - Characteristics **Faster** than HDDs with no moving parts, more durable, but typically more expensive per GB.

## Characteristics

- **Capacity**: Measured in bytes (e.g., Gigabytes, Terabytes).
- **Speed**: Influences overall system performance; faster memory enables quicker data access and processing.
- **Volatility**: Determines whether the memory retains data without power.
- **Form Factor**: Physical size and shape, which varies for different computing devices (e.g., DIMMs for desktops, SODIMMs for laptops).

## Function in Computer Systems

- Serves as the primary workspace for the processor, directly affecting processing speed and multitasking capabilities.
- Stores critical system data and user applications temporarily for quick access and processing.
- Plays a key role in system booting and executing **[[BIOS]]/UEFI** instructions.
