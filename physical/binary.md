The binary system is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent values. It's the foundation of all modern [[computer]] systems.

Operates on the principles of powers of two, where each binary digit (**bit**) represents an exponential increase in value.

## Representation of Data

- **Text** and characters are represented using binary codes, typically through encoding systems like **ASCII** or **Unicode**.
- **Images** are represented as a collection of bits, with **each** **pixel** or color component being encoded in binary. Formats like JPEG or PNG use specific algorithms to convert these binary representations into images.
- Binary data is often represented in **hexadecimal** (0x) for simplicity, as it's more compact and human-readable. One hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (a nibble).

## Units

- **Bit**: A single binary digit, the smallest unit of data in computing.
- **Byte**: Comprises 8 bits, commonly used as a basic unit for most computer systems.
- **Word**: In computing, a word typically refers to the standard unit of data used by a particular processor design. A word is usually **2 bytes** (16 bits) or more, depending on the architecture.

## Storage and Operations

- Binary data is stored in [[physical memory]] where bits are typically represented by different levels of electrical charge or magnetic polarity.
- Binary operations are performed using [[logical gates]].
- **Combining** multiple binary sequences is a fundamental operation, especially in data processing and computing algorithms.

## Significance

- Binary is the core language of computers, where every operation, calculation, and data representation is ultimately broken down into sequences of 0s and 1s.
- The simplicity of binary allows for **efficient** data processing and storage, forming the basis of almost all modern digital technology.
