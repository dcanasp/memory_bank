Virtual private [[Network]], a way to connect to another [[computer|machine]] and do all of the traffic from their [[IP]], You connect to them and they do the heavy work. This is useful in 2 cases:

- When you don't want your [[ISP]] or anyone on your [[network]] to spy on your online activity
- When your enterprise wants only the computers on premise/allowed to have access to their [[database]] and services. In other words, when you allow some computers to connect to your servers and databases, but only want those computers to have access and no one else

> It's important to note that a VPN does **NOT** make you invisible or  untraceable, you have to trust that the VPN provider doesn't sell your data (or gives it to the governments). If you want true(ish) invisibility use [[TOR]]
