A **Firewall** is a [[network]] security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is a barrier designed to prevent unauthorized or unwanted communications between sections of a computer network.

The firewall can block oncoming traffic (inbound rules) and outgoing traffic (outbound rules)
### Functionality

- **Traffic Control**: Firewalls control the flow of [[network]] traffic in and out of an organization by deciding whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a set of security rules.
- **Packet Filtering**: Examines each packet entering or leaving the network and accepts or rejects it based on user-defined rules.

### Types of Firewalls

1. **Packet-Filtering Firewalls**: The most basic form, which filters traffic based solely on source and destination [[IP]] addresses, [[port]] numbers, and [[protocols]].
2. **Stateful Inspection Firewalls**: Keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.
3. **[[proxy]] Firewalls (Application-Level Gateways)**: Filters network traffic at the application level.
4. **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**: Includes features like application awareness, deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention systems, and others.

### Implementation

- **[[hardware]] Firewalls**: Physical devices placed between your network and the gateway.
- **[[software]] Firewalls**: Software-based firewalls installed on servers or other network devices.
- **Cloud Firewalls (Firewall-as-a-Service)**: Provided and managed by third-party service providers in the cloud. An example is [[WAF]]

### Use Cases

- **Protecting Private Networks**: Keeps malicious traffic like viruses and hackers out of a private internal network.
- **Securing Online Transactions**: Ensures that financial transactions conducted over the internet are secure.
- **Regulating Network Traffic**: Helps manage and control the flow of traffic based on predefined rules.

### Key Features

- **Access Control**: Regulates who can access the network and what they can see and do.
- **[[VPN]] Support**: For secure remote access.
- **Reporting and Logging**: Keeps detailed logs of network activity.
