A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between [[computer]] [[network]]s. Routers perform **traffic directing** functions on the Internet. It has a role in determining the best path for data packets to travel across different networks.

# Types of Routers

- **Consumer Routers**
    Used in homes and small offices, provides Wi-Fi connectivity and usually includes a built-in switch to connect wired devices.
- **Enterprise Routers**
     Designed for large businesses or institutional networks. Has higher performance, reliability, and security features.
- **Core Routers**
     Operate in the backbone of the Internet, handling high-capacity data transfer.
- **Edge Routers**
     Positioned at the edge of a network, connecting to external networks, especially the Internet.

# Key Features of Routers

- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**
    Allows **multiple devices** on a local network to **share** a single **public** [[IP]] address for Internet access.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**
     Automatically assigns [[IP]] addresses to devices on a network.
- [[Firewall]] **and Security Features**
     Protects the network from unauthorized access and various security threats.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**
     Manages and prioritizes bandwidth usage for different applications or devices.

# Router Interfaces and Ports
This is a generalization. Not all routers are the same, but a general overview is:
- **Ethernet Ports**
    For wired connections to computers and other network devices.
- **WAN Ports**
     Connects to an external network, typically the Internet.
- **USB Ports**
     For connecting external devices like printers or storage devices.
- **Wireless Interfaces**
     Wi-Fi antennas for wireless communication with devices.
