Sand really small and drilled so that information can be send via light speed. are primarily used for high-speed data transmission. They form the backbone of many network infrastructures, enabling efficient, high-bandwidth communication between data centers, within internet infrastructure, and in local area networks (LANs).

## Advantages
- **High Bandwidth**: Capable of supporting extremely high data transmission rates, far exceeding those of traditional copper cables.
- **Low Signal Loss**: Optical fibers experience very low levels of signal loss over long distances, making them ideal for long-range communication.
- **Security**: The nature of light transmission in fiber cables makes them less susceptible to eavesdropping and interference compared to copper cables.
