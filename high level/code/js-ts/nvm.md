- Switch between Node.js versions easily
- Remove Node.js versions you no longer need

**Benefits:**
- **Improved workflow:** NVM can help you improve your workflow by allowing you to switch between Node.js versions quickly and easily.
- **Compatibility:** NVM can help you ensure that your code is compatible with different versions of Node.js.
- **Testing:** NVM can help you test your code on different versions of Node.js before deploying it to production.
