Content Delivery [[Network]] or Content Distribution [[Network]].

Instead of saving all of the data in your [[server]], the CDN saves the heavy data on it self, so the user does not have to go to the end of the world to find an image. There should be multiple CDN's and located in different parts of the world, so it loads faster for everyone

CDN can deliver 2 different things.

- Static Content:
	For those pages that never change (a news portal, where it will never change)
- Dynamic Content:
	For those pages that change all the time for every user, CDN can save some data (a like given) so it doesn't have to go to the server every time
# jobs
### caching 
storing copies of the data so it can be access faster 
### Dynamic acceleration
it makes the comunication faster and more efficient 
### Edge logic computation
Make the CDN work so your server doesn't have to
