the Graphics Processing Unit. Specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.

Handles **rendering** of images, video, and 2D/3D animations, offloading these tasks from the CPU. And any other work that you want to do in an efficient parallel way

## Architecture

- **Core Components**:
    - *Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)* Consist of smaller, more efficient cores designed for parallel processing.
    - *VRAM (Video RAM)*: Dedicated memory for storing frame buffer and textures.
    - *ROPs (Raster Operations Pipelines)*: Convert 3D objects into 2D pixels.
- Designed for simultaneous calculations, excelling in tasks requiring parallel processing power.

## Types

- **Integrated GPUs**: Built into the CPU; shares system memory. Suitable for basic tasks.
- **Discrete GPUs**: Separate card with dedicated memory. Offers higher performance for gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, and computational tasks.

## Importance

- Crucial for gaming, 3D rendering, and high-definition video playback.
- Utilized in scientific research, **machine learning**, and data analysis for their efficient **parallel** processing capabilities.
- Used in various applications for speeding up tasks like video encoding/decoding, image processing.
