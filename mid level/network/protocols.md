Network protocols are sets of **rules** or standards that dictate **how data** is **transmitted** and received in a [[network]]. They ensure reliable and secure communication between devices. Protocols define everything from the format of data packets to error handling and data compression methods.

# Types of Network Protocols

- **Communication Protocols**
    Govern the direct communication between devices ( TCP, UDP).
- **Routing Protocols**
     Manage the paths along which data travels in the network (BGP, OSPF).
- **Security Protocols**
     Ensure data security and integrity during transmission ([[SSL]]/TLS).

# Main Network Protocols

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
    - Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. Uses the [[three way handshake]]
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
    - A simpler, connectionless protocol for applications that do not require ordered data.
- [[IP]] **(Internet Protocol)**
    - Responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host based on IP addresses.
- [[HTTP]] **(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
    - Used for transferring web pages over the Internet.
- [[HTTPS]] **(HTTP Secure)**
    - An extension of HTTP with security features for encrypted communication.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
    - Used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**
    - Provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, commonly used for logging into remote machines.
- [[DNS]] **(Domain Name System)**
    - Translates domain names into IP addresses.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
    - Used for sending emails.
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**
    - Used for retrieving emails from a server.
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**
    - Manages and monitors network devices like routers and switches.
