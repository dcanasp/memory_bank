###### Used in [[Linux]]

refers to the endianness or the [[binary|byte]] order in which data is stored. These concepts are critical for data serialization, network communications, and interoperability between different computer architectures.

#### Big Endian

In Big Endian systems, the most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address.

Example: Let's consider the hexadecimal number `0x12345678`.

Memory Layout in Big Endian:

```
Address 0: 0x12
Address 1: 0x34
Address 2: 0x56
Address 3: 0x78
```
