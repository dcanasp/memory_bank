An agile framework for organizing and managing work. They follow some practices

Leverages variability and uncertainty of project development. With an unknowable amount of iterations (as many sprints as needed)

# why scrum

When working on a project, we used to do things linearly, first define all of the requirements, find all of the variables, and finally do it.

This rarely works. Scrum accepts variability and embraces it, it an agile methodology as it will allow for changes at any time (even changes of concepts). It listens to feedback on every step of the way.

Scrum might take more time up front. But it will save as time goes on (and project grows)
# Scrum practices
## roles
### product owner
- Having the vision on what you are building 
- Defining features
- Assigning priorities 
### scrum master
- Guiding the scrum
- A facilitator  
- has *NO* authority over the team. They are a leader, not manager
- They could be a developer
### development team
- Determine the how to do it
- Do the actual work
- 5-9 people
## activities
### Sprint *planning*
- Define sprint goal
- Define sprint backlog
- Last four to eight hours (for a half or whole month)
### Sprint execution
- Doing the backlog
- No developer is told what to chose from the backlog

### *daily* scrum
- 15 minutes
- Talk what was done, what are the plans, what obstacles are there
- Keep it big pictured, NOTHING specific
### sprint *review*
- Inspect and adapt the product
- Get feedback from the stake holders

### sprint *retrospective*
- Inspect and adapting the scrum process
## artifacts
### Product backlog
- list of elements to be done
- ordered by priority
- constantly evolving, can be added, deleted, modified
- uses story points (following Fibonacci sequence) to assign difficulty
### Sprint backlog
- The selected list of the backlog that we will build in a single sprint
## rules


# Bigger teams

In case of bigger teams, (e.g. 35 workers). We should have multiple scrum teams with 5-9 workers

# mistakes

## waterScrum

Don’t make every sprint for a single type of work. This will create a waterfall. For example, sprint 1 (designing) sprint 2 (coding) sprint 3 (testing). You just created a waterfall development with extra steps

# technical debt

The shortcuts we take and the bad practices we apply. For example not having tests, not having integration, defects that we left for the time being. After a while this debt will *come back* and with *interests*

Technical debt is inevitable and sometimes it is good. but we must erase it as soon as we can.
