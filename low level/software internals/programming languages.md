#todo: check what are v tables on object oriented programs


mainly there are 3 types
- [[compiled languages]]
- [[interpreted languages]]
- [[transpiled languages]]

But is very important to understand that every single language has it's usages, some are better than others at X or Y. There is no unique perfect solution, there will always be tradeoffs. Pick yours 
And another incredibly important thing to have in mind is the design philosophy of each language, python it's not worse than java, it's different. You should never write java-like code on python, as it's not taking advantage of it's capabilities

the best code it's NOT the fastest, it's the organized one, it's the understandable and manageable. Before you can write good code you need to learn to "read" code

>[!important] good code design
>Make it **correct**, make it **clear**, make it concise, **make** it **fast**. In that order

the ones i mainly know:

- [[dotnet]]

- [[Go]]
