Data types are a the different shapes that the data can take, these vary (some times drastically) from [[programming languages|language]] to language

All languages need them to run, but they can be set [[interpreted languages|JIT]] or [[compiled languages|At the start]]
### Numeric

**Integer**: Whole numbers, both positive and negative.
**Float**: Numbers with fractional parts.
**Double**: float larger
Some languages like rust make the distinction between Signed and Unsinged numbers (allows negative or not)

### Text

**Character**: Single alphabet, or symbol.
**String**: On traditional languages an array of characters

### Boolean
**Boolean**: True or False values.

###  Non-Primitive

These data types are not built into the language but are created by the programmer. They include:
    
**Arrays**: Collection of elements of the same data type (unless python).
**Strings**: they should be here.
**Structures**: Collection of different data types.
**Classes**: Basis of object-oriented programming, encapsulating data and functions.
