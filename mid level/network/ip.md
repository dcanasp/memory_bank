direction that identifies a [[computer]], or anything that has a internet access.

There are two types of ip's Ipv4 and Ipv6. as of writing this, Ipv4 has reached it's maximum address number (4 billion <american billion> )

A big problem with Ipv4 is that you normally only get one public IP per house, and it's on the router, your computer does NOT access the internet, it has a private Ip, that data is re routed to the router, and then it gets send, when sent the router keeps your MAC address to return the package to you

Ipv6 is notably larger, 2^128. so there will not be the current problem with ipv4. 

There are also two types of ip's. Public and private, public are the ones that can directly connect to the internet. Private are the ones that only can be access inside the same [[network]]:
- Class A: `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
- Class B: `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
- Class C: `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`

They are normally set via [[dhcp]]
